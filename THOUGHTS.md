### Some thoughts on social networking services
#### The problem: Closed-source platform, one maintainer
Ever since the idea of social networking as a service came about, their have
been many approaches to address one simple idea: connecting people together.
Many of the more prominent social networking services that have come into
existence have utilized a closed-source platform with the direction being
driven by the maintainer of the service. As a direct consequence, the decisions
made by the maintainer must be accepted by the users of the service. This can
be quite frustrating for users that don't like the decisions that are made,
which might result in departure.
#### A solution: Open-source, contributor driven
What if the platform was open-source, and the direction of the social
networking service was defined by the users? Improvements on the service could
be done through contributions from users of the service itself. Users could
also be in control of the service, and therefore they would get to choose what
they want and what they don't want. They would also get to see how the  service
is run because they would have direct access to the source and contributors to
particular features.
#### Modularizing the service
If the direction of the social networking service were defined by the users,
they should be able to choose what core services they consume. For example, a
user could choose to consume a sub-service involved with connecting to friends
and another sub-service to message their friends, but reject a sub-service that
involves browsing through a stream of updates from their friends. This would
give the user more control and flexibility over what they want and don't want
when using a social networking service.
#### Customizing the service
A hypothetical social networking service could provide a basic core sub-service
and allow the user to customize it to their desire. For example, a standard
stream of updates from a users' friends could be provided, but the way that the
updates are organized could be customized by the users. Users wouldn't have to
adhere to an ordering decided upon by the maintainer of the service, but
instead would see the exact ordering that they decide on.
