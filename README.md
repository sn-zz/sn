# the social network - overview
This document is a general overview of the social network service. The social network is a centralized, contribution-driven service that allows for users (such as individuals or organizations) to connect and interact with one another.

## Features
Though the service is rich with features, they are loosely coupled. Any particular user has the ability to choose which features they desire to use. The following is a rough list of what features the bootstrap release of the social network will include.

- Profile
- Friends
- Updates (status, photo, and link for now)
- Stream (view updates from other users)
- Subscriptions & Notifications
- Messages
- Groups

Beyond the initial set of features, the following is a list of desired features that will be considered, but not developed for the bootstrap release.

- Video
- Tagging (in content such as photos and videos)
- Location (as part of updates and messages)

## How to contribute
The social network service uses a [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow). In order to make a contribution, users must fork the [main repository](https://github.com/sn/sn), make changes to their fork, and [open a pull request](https://github.com/sn/sn/pulls) on GitHub. Alternatively, a user can [open an issue](https://github.com/sn/sn/issues) on GitHub, allowing for other users to make the necessary changes. When the pull request is capable of merging, it must go through a voting process. A passing vote will give the go ahead to merge, followed by a deploy to production.

## How voting works
Coming soon.
