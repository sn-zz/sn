This document contains the vision of the social network service. The social network is an open source, community driven service that allows for users (such as individuals or organizations) to connect and interact with one another.

## Goals
The social network service has three goals to accomplish. These goals have been chosen to address frustrations that have arisen from previous social networking services. Below is a summary of these goals, while a more comprehensive overview is addressed in sections to follow.

- *Open source*. The service shall be open source and freely available to download.
- *Community driven*. Every addition to the service is done so through contribution.
- *Centralized*. The service shall run on a centralized platform.

### Open source
The service shall be open source and freely available to download. This is to ensure maximum transparency for the users that use the service. Users should have the ability to also see how the service processes and stores their data.

### Community driven
Every addition to the service shall be done so through contribution. This means that every user of the service can have an influence on the direction of the service itself.

### Centralized platform
The service shall run on a centralized platform. This will ensure that the service doesn't depend on the resource of the users and will be free standing. Consumers of the service should not be required to provide resource necessary to keep the service active.
