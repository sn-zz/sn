# the social network - agenda
This is a rough agenda of what I have planned for the social network. Feedback is appreciated. This may change over time.

1. Overview - Finish writing the [overview](OVERVIEW.md) and [vision](VISION.md). This is going to help iron out all of the decisions on how the service will work, including governance, features, and more.
2. [Schema](SCHEMA.md) - A representation of each feature, as well as how these features might interact with one another.
3. [API](API.md) - Start writing an API specification for the backend.
4. [Technologies](TECH.md) - Decide which technologies to use for the service.
5. Develop, develop, develop.
